            <h2>Project Brief</h2>
            <p>An exquisite architecture with Luxury,
                Comfort and Class.
                <br> <br>
                Our task was to build or rebrand Archmove’s website that showed off
                their exquisite collection of architecture
                in a way that not only captivates the consumer
                but draws them in. It was a big one!
                <br> <br>
                We were asked to help re-establish an online
                which was lost. We led the design work,
                well as helped them find a new development
                that could meet their ongoing needs as well as a new design approach.
                Eventually, our relationship developed into us becoming brand guardians.
                <br> <br>

                For one, we can’t quite say this is a case
                study because it’ll be more storyish, or
                reiteration of best practices and
                methods applied throughout our
                development process. Welcome to our
                case study!
                <br> <br>

                Our task was set. It’s our turn to
                accomplish it and overdo just a little.

            <h2>UX/UI</h2>
            <p>Every part and process of the User
                Experience has to feel organic. Our
                philosophy is that whenever the user
                can barely notice or tell interactive
                changes or phases between interactions,
                then our job is half done. I can’t quite
                say this is a case study because it’ll be
                more story- ish, but hey! Welcome to my
                first case study! So to start with, the
                design brief looked something like
                “Design a landing page for your friend’s
                restaurant business. The entire page
                should be done solely with typography.
                No vector illustrations of food or
                persons is allowed.” That was new! In
                all my few) months of design, I had
                always used images to draw the user’s
                eye and evoke the
                emotions I wanted to. Now I had to do it
                all with typography! A few things
                became immediately clear:

                <img class="desktop-img" src="/img/work-inner/desk-ux-2.png" alt="">

            <h2>Visual identity</h2>
            <p>Archmove is a major construction business based in Ohio, USA.
                Their main business was quality architecture and building comfortable homes.
                So I had to make sure that this message came across on their website.
                Their visual identity has to speak to trust, quality and value.
                And there were no better colors than these.
                Blue signifies loyalty and trust, that reddish-orange signals bright quality,
                toned down against the dark blue which embeds the quality of true value.

            <h2>Branding</h2>
            <p>A company’s brand or business believe it or not has a hiuge role to play in its successes. Great
                Brands are memorable, simple and clear. This was our motivation, it had to go down in the records
                That every aspect of creating a cohesive brand identity had to glue together or else, it may result
                In something we like to call ‘Disjointed Brand’ — where the brand speaks one thing different from what
                it
                actually means or intends to mean. Tis clash of identity and purpose is crucial.
                Our team tackles by having an in-depth study into how best their brand could be elevated, what’s missing
                and
                what has to go. More often the not, we find ourselves subtracting
                elements than adding elements to an already well-designed narrative.
                <br> <br>

                Tackling mobile was also a huge part of the task we had, something the client felt very
                strongly about. Again, our modular approach really proved it’s worth as
                we able to more tightly control the UX for mobile.
